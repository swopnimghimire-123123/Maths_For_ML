# ðŸ“˜ Linear Algebra Learning Journey

This repository documents my step-by-step journey into **Linear Algebra**, with a focus on building both **theoretical intuition** and **practical coding skills** (Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, SymPy).  
The goal is to connect math with code, preparing for **Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI applications**.
