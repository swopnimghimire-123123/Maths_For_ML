# Math with Code 📘💻

This repository is a collection of my **math learning journey** where I combine theory with practice.  
For every topic I study (like vectors, matrices, calculus, probability, etc.), I upload:

- ✍️ **Handwritten notes** – key definitions, formulas, and explanations  
- 🧑‍💻 **Code implementations** – Jupyter/Colab notebooks with practical applications  

## 📂 Structure
Each folder/topic contains:
- `Notes/` → PDF/Images of my handwritten notes  
- `Notebooks/` → Python notebooks (`.ipynb`) with examples and implementations  

## 🚀 Topics Covered
- Vectors and their operations  
- Matrices and linear algebra basics  
- Calculus (derivatives, integrals, limits)  
- Probability and statistics  
- More topics coming as I learn 📚  

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Libraries: NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas (where required)  

## 🌟 Purpose
This repo helps me **connect mathematical concepts with coding practice** while building a resource I can revisit and share with others.
